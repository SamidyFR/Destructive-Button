# Destructive Button

Destructuctive button is well... a destructive button.

silly little python script that messes with your computer!

# Heres How it Works:

you tell the python script to press the button, and it chooses to do one of 5 of these things:

• Delete System32 (Most Dangerous)

• Delete all of your games (if you have some)

• Download malware 

• Tries to crash your system (least dangerous tbh, likely wont do much, worst thing it will do is crash ur pc if you have a bad computer.)

• Delete your downloads folder


basically, the script hates your Computer.

# How To use:
1. Download a virtual machine, a good one is [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (HIGHLY RECCOMENDED, PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS SCRIPT ON YOUR MAIN OR WORK COMPUTER.)
2. Download [Python](https://www.python.org/)
3. Download the script
4. run it (MAKE SURE TO RUN IT AS ADMIN. IT WONT WORK PROPERLY IF NOT)

And thats it!

(also btw, quick little end warning, i obviously didn't test this as i dont want my computer to be a toaster, and i couldn't get a vm setup, so if you for some reason decide to use this please let me know for any issues.)

Have A Nice Day!
